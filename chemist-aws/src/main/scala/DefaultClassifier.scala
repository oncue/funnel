/**
 * This default implementation does not properly handle the various upgrade
 * cases that you might encounter when migrating from one set of clusters to
 * another, but it instead provided as a default where all available flasks
 * and chemists are are "active". There are a set of upgrade scenarios where
 * you do not want to mirror from an existing flask cluster, so they are not
 * targets, nor are they active flasks.
 *
 * Providing this function with a task return type so that extensions can do I/O
 * if they need too (clearly a cache locally would be needed in that case)
 *
 * It is highly recommended you override this with your own classification logic.
